How to use it
-------------

You should already have script required for Angular

```

to the list above, you should add:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="ng-twitter.min.css">
```

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="ng-twitter.min.js"></script>
```

Then, inject `ngTwitter` in your application module:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngTwitter']);
```

and then just add an `div` with `tweets` directive name attribute, `authKey` and 'hashtag' scope variable attribute.

```html
<div tweets key="authKey" hashtag="hashtag" button="true" count="15" refresh="60"/>
```

`authKey`, 'hashtag' are your scope authentication key variable.

```javascript
$scope.authKey = 'bzJZSlN4ZnJUYWhyeXdub2R4MzJBOkFHSmw5MnJIeEFTRkpYVW9BSm8zMEpTQzU2Wm0zNFZxZmFVZFh1TUZWamc=';
