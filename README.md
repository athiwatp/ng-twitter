ng-twitter
=====================

Angular directive tweets display.

Idea is to provide a tweet listing for you website.

I have made some tests just using angular with http service to query Twitter API (authentication, query) but have faced cors
issue, just working on localhost.

So one thing you need to do on you own is the server side.

Demo

Installation
------------

Using npm:

```
npm install ng-twitter
```

How to use it
-------------

You should already have script required for Angular, note sanitize module use.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular-sanitize.min.js"></script>
```

to the list above, you should add:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="ng-twitter.min.css">
```

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="ng-twitter.min.js"></script>
```

Then, inject `ngTwitter` in your application module:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngTwitter']);
```

and then just add an `div` with `tweets` directive name attribute, `hashtag` scope variable attribute.

```html
<div tweets hashtag="hashtag" button="true" count="15" refresh="60"/>
```

'hashtag' is your default hashtag search value.

```javascript
$scope.hashtag = 'football';
```

### Attribute

* `hashtag`: scope hashtag string variable object, default 'football'
* `button`: show refresh button, default true
* `hash`: show refresh button, default true
* `refresh`: scope variable, refresh time

Example with all above features:

```html
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="ctrl">
	<div tweets hashtag="hashtag" hash="true" button="true" count="5" refresh="10"/>		
</div>
```

### Build

You can run the tests by running

```
npm install
```
or
```
npm test
```

assuming you already have `grunt` installed, otherwise you also need to do:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
